# Raw assets

**What are assets?** Anything from sound, to sprite art, to landscape art, to user interface design, to music.

## Uploading assets

### Using GitHub web interface (easiest)

- Only upload assets to the Raw folder: https://github.com/terebigeemu/ludum-dare-49/tree/main/Raw
- Click **Add file** > **Upload file** then drag and drop.
- Provide a detailed changelog message of what you changed.
- In the options, make sure **Commit directly to the `main`** branch is selected.

### Using git command line (full control)

- Follow the steps here: https://gist.github.com/aidswidjaja/8adeb33badb0f4f790f9b36bcd5a752f (ignore "Before you start")
